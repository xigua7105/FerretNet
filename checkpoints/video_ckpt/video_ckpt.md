- <h4>ðŸ¤”Q1: How to obtain the dataset for training?</h4> âœ…A1: The training data only contains ProGan-4cls, and no additional data is needed.
- <h4>ðŸ¤”Q2: What is the architecture of the model?</h4> âœ…A2: The backbone is FerretNet-B (ferretnet-b-median-3) without any adjustments.</h4>
- <h4>ðŸ¤”Q3: Can the model be used for synthetic image detection?</h4> âœ…A3: This model can detect both synthetic images in lossless PNG format and JPEG-compressed lossy images. It exhibits excellent robustness and generalization capabilities, making it suitable for the rapid detection of images and videos posted on social media.
- <h4>ðŸ¤”Q4: Why does the model trained with the provided code fail to detect synthetic videos or compressed lossy images?</h4> âœ…A4: The training data remains the same, while the training process has been optimized. The improved method significantly enhances the robustness. More implementation details will be released soon.
